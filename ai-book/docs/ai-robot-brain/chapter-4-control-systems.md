# Control Systems

This chapter covers the fundamentals of robotic control systems in AI-powered robotics applications and their implementation on specialized computing platforms.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of robotic control systems and their architectures
- Apply control algorithms for robotic applications
- Evaluate the real-time performance requirements for control systems

## Chapter Content

Robotic control systems form the executive layer that translates high-level goals and plans into low-level motor commands that drive robot actuators. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of control systems for AI-powered robots.

Control systems in robotics operate at multiple levels, from high-level task planning to low-level motor control. Each level has different requirements for accuracy, response time, and robustness, requiring specialized algorithms and computing resources.

Feedback control is fundamental to robotic systems, enabling robots to adjust their behavior based on sensor information and environmental changes. These systems continuously compare desired and actual states, computing corrective actions to minimize errors.

Modern robotic control systems increasingly incorporate learning-based approaches that adapt to changing conditions and improve performance over time. These adaptive systems can handle uncertainties and variations that are difficult to model explicitly.

Real-time control requirements demand deterministic performance and low-latency responses. Specialized computing platforms provide the necessary performance characteristics to meet these stringent requirements while maintaining safety and reliability.
