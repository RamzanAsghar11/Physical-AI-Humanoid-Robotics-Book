## Chapter Content

Perception systems form the sensory foundation of AI-powered robots, enabling them to interpret and understand their environment. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of perception systems on specialized computing platforms.

Perception in robotics encompasses multiple modalities including vision, audition, tactile sensing, and environmental detection. These systems process raw sensor data to extract meaningful information about the robot's surroundings, enabling intelligent decision-making and interaction.

The architecture of perception systems typically involves multiple processing layers, from low-level sensor data acquisition to high-level semantic understanding. Each layer performs specific transformations that progressively extract more abstract information from the raw sensory inputs.

Computational requirements for perception systems vary significantly based on the complexity of the tasks and the required real-time performance. Advanced perception tasks such as 3D scene understanding and object recognition demand substantial processing power, making specialized AI computing platforms essential.

Integration of perception systems with robot control architectures requires careful consideration of timing, accuracy, and reliability. Perception outputs must be delivered with appropriate latency and confidence levels to support safe and effective robot operation.
