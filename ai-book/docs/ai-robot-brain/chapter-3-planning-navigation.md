# Planning & Navigation

This chapter covers the fundamentals of robotic planning and navigation systems in AI-powered robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of robotic path planning and navigation
- Apply planning algorithms for autonomous robot navigation
- Evaluate the computational requirements for real-time navigation systems

## Chapter Content

Planning and navigation systems enable autonomous robots to move intelligently through their environment while avoiding obstacles and achieving specific goals. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of planning and navigation systems on specialized AI computing platforms.

Robotic planning involves generating sequences of actions or trajectories that enable a robot to achieve its objectives while respecting environmental constraints and safety requirements. This process typically involves multiple levels of abstraction, from high-level mission planning to low-level motion control.

Navigation systems integrate planning algorithms with perception data to enable robots to move through unknown or dynamic environments. These systems must handle uncertainty in sensor data, dynamic obstacles, and changing environmental conditions while maintaining safe and efficient operation.

Path planning algorithms range from simple reactive methods to complex optimization-based approaches. The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as environmental complexity, real-time requirements, and the level of optimality required for the specific application.

Real-time navigation requires efficient algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions while maintaining performance guarantees. This often involves hierarchical approaches that combine global path planning with local obstacle avoidance.
