# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course. This comprehensive textbook explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, focusing on embodied intelligence through ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into 8 comprehensive modules, each containing 6 detailed chapters:

1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding the communication and control backbone of robotic systems
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Exploring simulation environments for robotics development
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Learning about AI computing platforms for robotics
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrating perception, understanding, and action systems
5. **Humanoid Mechanics** - Understanding the mechanical design of humanoid robots
6. **Perception & SLAM** - Learning about sensing and mapping in robotics
7. **Conversational Robotics** - Exploring human-robot interaction and communication
8. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid** - Bringing all concepts together in a comprehensive project

## Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will:
- Understand the fundamental principles of physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Gain conceptual knowledge of key robotics technologies and platforms
- Learn how to design and think about AI systems in physical contexts
- Develop an understanding of the integration challenges in humanoid robotics

## How to Use This Textbook

Each chapter follows a consistent structure with learning objectives, detailed explanations, and assessment questions. You can navigate through the modules using the sidebar to the left.

The content is designed to be conceptual and theoretical, focusing on understanding the principles rather than practical implementation details.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes a basic understanding of artificial intelligence and robotics concepts. Familiarity with programming concepts is helpful but not required, as this textbook focuses on conceptual understanding rather than implementation details.
