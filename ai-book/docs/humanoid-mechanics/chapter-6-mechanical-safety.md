# Mechanical Safety

This chapter covers the fundamental principles of mechanical safety in humanoid robotics systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the safety considerations in humanoid robot mechanical design
- Apply safety mechanisms for humanoid robot applications
- Evaluate the trade-offs between performance and safety in mechanical systems

## Chapter Content

Mechanical safety is paramount in humanoid robotics due to the close interaction between robots and humans in shared environments. This chapter explores the safety considerations and mechanisms required to ensure safe operation of humanoid robots.

Collision safety mechanisms are essential for preventing injury to humans and damage to the environment during robot operation. These include soft actuators, compliant joints, and impact-absorbing materials that minimize the force of unintended contacts.

Emergency stop systems provide immediate halt capabilities when safety-critical situations arise. These systems must be fail-safe and capable of stopping all robot motion within minimal time while avoiding secondary hazards.

Force and torque limiting is crucial for safe human-robot interaction. Mechanical and control-based limits prevent the robot from applying excessive forces that could cause injury or damage during normal operation or unexpected contact.

Redundancy in safety-critical mechanical components ensures continued safe operation even when individual components fail. This includes backup actuators, multiple sensors, and fail-safe mechanisms that maintain safety even during system failures.

Safety standards and certification requirements guide the design and implementation of safe humanoid robots. Compliance with standards such as ISO 13482 for service robots ensures that safety considerations are properly addressed in robot design.
