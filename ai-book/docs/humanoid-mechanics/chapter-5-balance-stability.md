# Balance & Stability

This chapter covers the principles of balance and stability in humanoid robotics systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of balance and stability in humanoid robots
- Apply balance control strategies for humanoid robot applications
- Evaluate the factors affecting stability in dynamic humanoid movements

## Chapter Content

Balance and stability are fundamental challenges in humanoid robotics, as these systems must maintain equilibrium while performing complex tasks and navigating dynamic environments. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations and practical approaches to achieving balance and stability in humanoid robots.

The stability of humanoid robots depends on maintaining their center of mass within the support polygon defined by their feet. This requires continuous adjustment of the robot's posture and movements to counteract external disturbances and maintain equilibrium.

Balance control strategies include both passive and active approaches. Passive stability relies on mechanical design features such as low center of mass and wide stance, while active control uses sensors and actuators to continuously adjust the robot's position and orientation.

The capture point is a key concept in humanoid balance, representing the location where the robot must step to stop its motion and maintain balance. Understanding capture point dynamics is essential for planning stable walking patterns and recovery strategies.

Reactive balance control responds to detected balance disturbances by adjusting the robot's movements to restore stability. These systems must react quickly to prevent falls while ensuring that corrective actions do not introduce new instabilities.

Predictive balance control anticipates potential balance issues and proactively adjusts the robot's movements to maintain stability. This approach is particularly important for dynamic tasks and interactions with the environment.

## Key Takeaways
