## Chapter Content

Mechanical components form the physical foundation of humanoid robots, enabling them to move, interact with their environment, and perform tasks. This chapter explores the various mechanical components and their roles in humanoid robot design and operation.

Actuators are the primary components responsible for generating motion in humanoid robots. Servo motors, stepper motors, and more advanced actuators like series elastic actuators provide the force and control necessary for human-like movements. The choice of actuators affects the robot's strength, speed, precision, and safety.

Joints in humanoid robots replicate the functionality of human joints, allowing for multi-degree-of-freedom motion. These joints must provide the appropriate range of motion while maintaining structural integrity and safety. Common joint types include revolute, prismatic, and spherical joints.

The structural framework of humanoid robots must be lightweight yet strong enough to support the robot's weight and handle external forces. Materials selection and structural design are critical for achieving the desired balance between strength, weight, and cost.

Transmission systems transfer power from actuators to joints, often including gearboxes, belts, and linkages. These systems must efficiently transfer power while providing the necessary torque multiplication and motion control for precise movements.

Sensors integrated into mechanical components provide feedback on position, force, and other parameters essential for control. These include encoders, force/torque sensors, and tactile sensors that enable the robot to perceive its own state and interactions with the environment.
