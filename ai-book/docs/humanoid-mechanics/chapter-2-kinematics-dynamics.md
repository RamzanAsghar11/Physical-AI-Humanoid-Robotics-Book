# Kinematics & Dynamics

This chapter covers the fundamentals of kinematics and dynamics in humanoid robotics systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of kinematics and dynamics in humanoid robots
- Apply kinematic and dynamic models for humanoid robot analysis
- Evaluate the computational requirements for kinematic and dynamic calculations

## Chapter Content

Kinematics and dynamics form the mathematical foundation for understanding and controlling humanoid robot motion. This chapter explores the theoretical principles and practical applications of kinematic and dynamic modeling in humanoid robotics.

Kinematics deals with the geometric relationships of robot motion without considering the forces that cause the motion. Forward kinematics calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector based on joint angles, while inverse kinematics determines the required joint angles to achieve a desired end-effector position.

Dynamics considers the forces and torques that cause robot motion, including inertial forces, Coriolis forces, and gravitational effects. Dynamic models are essential for accurate control of humanoid robots, particularly during complex movements and interactions with the environment.

The kinematic structure of humanoid robots typically involves multiple closed-loop chains that represent arms, legs, and the torso. These structures require sophisticated algorithms to solve forward and inverse kinematic problems efficiently.

Dynamic modeling of humanoid robots must account for the complex interactions between multiple limbs and the effects of ground contact during walking and other locomotion patterns. This requires advanced techniques such as the Newton-Euler method or Lagrangian mechanics.
