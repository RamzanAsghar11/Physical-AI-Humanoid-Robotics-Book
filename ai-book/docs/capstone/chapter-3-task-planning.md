# Task Planning

This chapter covers the fundamental principles and techniques of task planning in autonomous humanoid robotics systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand different approaches to task planning for humanoid robots
- Apply planning algorithms and techniques for robotic applications
- Evaluate the integration of task planning with other robotic subsystems

## Chapter Content

Task planning in autonomous humanoid robots involves generating sequences of actions to achieve complex goals while considering environmental constraints, robot capabilities, and safety requirements. This chapter explores various planning approaches and their implementation in humanoid robotics.

Hierarchical task planning decomposes complex goals into simpler subtasks that can be executed by the robot. This approach enables robots to handle complex, multi-step tasks by organizing them into manageable components with defined relationships and dependencies.

Motion planning focuses on generating collision-free paths for robot movement while considering kinematic and dynamic constraints. This is particularly challenging for humanoid robots due to their complex structure and multiple degrees of freedom.

Temporal planning incorporates timing constraints and coordination between different robot subsystems. This ensures that actions are executed in the correct sequence and at appropriate times to achieve the desired outcome.

Multi-modal planning integrates different types of actions including manipulation, locomotion, and interaction behaviors. This requires coordination between various robot capabilities to execute complex tasks effectively.

Replanning mechanisms allow robots to adapt their plans when encountering unexpected situations or changes in the environment. These mechanisms are essential for robust operation in dynamic environments.
