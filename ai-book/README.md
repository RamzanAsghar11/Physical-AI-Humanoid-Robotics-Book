# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Textbook

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course textbook project. This comprehensive textbook explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, focusing on embodied intelligence through ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into 8 comprehensive modules, each containing 6 detailed chapters:

1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding the communication and control backbone of robotic systems
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Exploring simulation environments for robotics development
3. **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Learning about AI computing platforms for robotics
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrating perception, understanding, and action systems
5. **Humanoid Mechanics** - Understanding the mechanical design of humanoid robots
6. **Perception & SLAM** - Learning about sensing and mapping in robotics
7. **Conversational Robotics** - Exploring human-robot interaction and communication
8. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid** - Bringing all concepts together in a comprehensive project
